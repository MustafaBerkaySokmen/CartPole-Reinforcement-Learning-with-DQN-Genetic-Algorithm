# CartPole-Reinforcement-Learning-with-DQN-Genetic-Algorithm
This project implements Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Genetic Algorithms to train an AI agent to play CartPole-v1 in OpenAI Gym. The project explores both neural network-based reinforcement learning (DQN) and evolutionary strategies (GA) for optimizing policy learning.
